# 3DS-Demos

I am placing some roms that I have legally obtained and then edited them into a demo, you may use them for [Citra](https://citra-emu.org/download/) to try the game if you like.

I used GodMode9 to extract the files. (.3ds / .tmd)

I used GodMode9 to convert the files. (.3ds -> .cia) / (.tmd -> .cia)

All ROMS are compiled here: [Mega](https://mega.nz/folder/FehEiQBL#fB0TzlL4uU-QGgM9-PEFCQ)

If you used some of these files and liked the demo, buy the game, don't pirate it.
