# 3DS-Demos

I am placing some roms that I have legally obtained and then edited them into a demo, you may use them for [Citra](https://citra-emu.org/download/) to try the game if you like.

I used GodMode9 to extract the .3ds file for use with Citra.

All ROMS are compiled here: [Mega](https://mega.nz/folder/FehEiQBL#fB0TzlL4uU-QGgM9-PEFCQ)

This shouldn't be piracy, this would be "borrowing" these files for Citra use. If you really like the game and have an old3DS or a new3DS, consider buying it.
