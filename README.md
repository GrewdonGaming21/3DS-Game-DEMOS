# 3DS-Demos

I am placing some demo roms that I have legally obtained. You may use them for [Citra](https://citra-emu.org/download/) to try the game if you like.

I used [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9) to extract the files. (.3ds / .tmd)

I used [GodMode9](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9) to convert the files. (.3ds -> .cia) / (.tmd -> .cia)

All ROMS are compiled here: [Mega](https://mega.nz/folder/FehEiQBL#fB0TzlL4uU-QGgM9-PEFCQ)

If you used some of these files and liked the demo, buy the game, don't pirate it.

The [Issues](https://github.com/GrewdonGaming21/3DS-Game-Demos/issues) tab will only be used for "Looking for" threads that only I will create, but you can comment on it if you have the ROM I am looking for.
