# Grewdon3DS-Rep

I have compiled some roms that I have obtained legally, you may use them.

For hacking resources for your 3DS, go to https://3ds.hacks.guide/. You may find this helpful when you are hacking your Old/New 3DS.

Use FBI or a similar application to install .cia files.

If you are using FBI, you need:
The latest release of FBI (the .cia and .3dsx files) https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI/releases/latest.

All ROMS are compiled here: https://mega.nz/folder/FehEiQBL#fB0TzlL4uU-QGgM9-PEFCQ
